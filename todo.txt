1. Figure out how to send messages that indicate it was sent by a server
2. Figure out how to send messages that indicate it was sent by a client
3. Handle server and client messages differently
4. Add storage arrays for incoming information

note:  Servers are the only objects that can receive messages
Clients can send messages, but cannot receive them
therefore, we can send passenger information via the client to a server
then the server can either store that information or send it to another server
by opening up a quick connection (code already written for when a message is sent by a client)
code not written for a server receiving a message from another server


get rid of code for tiers

get rid of double adding to received payloads
